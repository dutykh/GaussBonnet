## Analytical Computations (Maple):

This repository also contains three Maple worksheet files with the analytical computations supporting our study:

- `maple/01-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-SCALAR CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the scalar perturbation case.
- `maple/02-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-TENSORIAL CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the tensorial perturbation case.
- `maple/03-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-VECTORIAL CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the vectorial perturbation case.

These files contain symbolic derivations and supplemental material relevant to the regression analysis performed in the MATLAB scripts.

## Linear Regression Analysis:

The `regression` folder contains MATLAB scripts that perform linear regression analysis on numerically computed spectral gap data for quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes in Gauss-Bonnet and Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Each script corresponds to a different type of perturbation (scalar, tensor, or vector) and analyzes the dependence of the spectral gap on the coupling parameter $\alpha$ and the mode number $L$.

### Main MATLAB Scripts:

- `scalarL.m` — Regression for scalar perturbations
- `tensorL.m` — Regression for tensor perturbations
- `vectorVI.m`, `vectorX.m`, `vectorXV.m` — Regression for various vector perturbations

### What the Scripts Do:

- Read and organize numerical data for different $(\alpha, L)$ pairs
- Compute the mean and standard deviation of the spectral gap for each pair
- Perform linear regression to fit the spectral gap as a function of $L$
- Visualize the results, saving figures (PDF/PNG) in the `shots` directory
- Save processed data in the `data` directory as `.mat` files

### How to Run:

1. Open MATLAB or GNU Octave in the `regression` directory.
2. Run any of the scripts (e.g., `scalarL.m`) by typing its name:
   ```matlab
   scalarL
   ```
   The script will automatically create `shots` and `data` subfolders if they do not exist.

## QNM Computation (MATLAB):

The `matlab` folder contains the script `chaseQNMs.m`, which computes Quasinormal Modes (QNMs) using pre-calculated matrix data.

### Main MATLAB Script:

-   `matlab/chaseQNMs.m` — Computes QNMs from matrix data generated by the analytical Maple computations.

### What the Script Does:

-   Loads matrix data (`M0.mat`, `M1.mat`, `M2.mat`) for different numerical resolutions from the `matlab/data/` subfolder. These matrices represent the coefficients of the polynomial eigenvalue problem derived from the perturbation equations.
-   Uses the **Advanpix Multiprecision Computing Toolbox** to solve the quadratic eigenvalue problem `(M2*lambda^2 + 1i*M1*lambda + M0) * x = 0` via the `polyeig` function to find the QNMs (`lambda`).
-   Computes QNMs for a list of specified resolutions (e.g., `[100, 120, 140]`).
-   Saves the computed QNMs for all resolutions in a cell array within the `matlab/qnms.mat` file.
-   Generates a basic plot showing the computed QNMs in the complex frequency plane (`Re(omega)` vs. `Im(omega)`), differentiating QNMs from different resolutions by color.

### Dependencies:

-   MATLAB (R2016a or later recommended for `polyeig`)
-   [Advanpix Multiprecision Computing Toolbox](https://www.advanpix.com/)

### How to Run:

1.  Ensure the Advanpix toolbox is installed and its path is correctly set within the `chaseQNMs.m` script (edit the `advanpixPath` variable).
2.  Make sure the required matrix data files (`M0_*.mat`, `M1_*.mat`, `M2_*.mat`) are present in the `matlab/data/` subdirectory. These files should be generated from the Maple worksheets.
3.  Open MATLAB in the `matlab` directory.
4.  Run the script by typing its name:
    ```matlab
    chaseQNMs
    ```
    The script will output progress to the command window, save the `qnms.mat` file, and display the QNM spectrum plot.

## Connection to Analytical Results:

The numerical computation of QNMs is informed by and heavily based upon the analytical computations in the Maple worksheet files. The symbolic derivations in the Maple files provide theoretical models and formulations and context for the numerical in the well-chosen variables.
