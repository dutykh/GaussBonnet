## Analytical Computations (Maple)

This repository also contains three Maple worksheet files with the analytical computations supporting our study:

- `maple/01-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-SCALAR CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the scalar perturbation case.
- `maple/02-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-TENSORIAL CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the tensorial perturbation case.
- `maple/03-NONEXTREME CASE-SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL-VECTORIAL CASE.mw`  
  Analytical calculations for the vectorial perturbation case.

These files contain symbolic derivations and supplemental material relevant to the regression analysis performed in the MATLAB scripts.

This is a minimal README. Please see the MATLAB scripts, Maple files, and LICENSE file for more information. This document will be expanded in the future.
